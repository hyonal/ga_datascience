Though the job might seem like a poisoned chalice, Bashir is determined to make change and stop the school from imminent closure. BashirÕs appointment is met with cynicism by a burnt-out staff and the students predict he wonÕt last a week. He wins over the school police liaison officer, Kellie, as he takes on the notorious Ahmad brothers. He devotes much attention to Tarek, the younger, volatile brother with whom he feels a connection. Just as it seems like heÕs making progress, TarekÕs brother Karim is found dead on school grounds. The police investigation threatens BashirÕs fledgling reforms, his support from staff and his resolve. He promises TarekÕs father that he will not lose another son.
